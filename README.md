taskerVoiceCommands
===================

Learning Tasker by understanding what others have done and building something to help me interact with my phone using voice commands.

Edit:
I just learned about AutoVoice. It may just do everything I was going to try to build from scratch.

Google Play app

Current music voice commands from Google Now.
  "Play me some music"
    Opens Google Play Music and shuffles my 
  "Next track"
    Untested
  "Pervious song"
    Untested
  "Stop music"
    This command unexpectedly causes music to switch from the headphones to the external speaker.

It should:
  While screen is locked (or, disable lock screen while headphones/mic are plugged in)
    1. Voice activated shuffle all music, skip (downloaded music only)
    2. Speak the time of day whenever asked
    9. Let me ask things like, "How far is it to work?" while assuming I mean from where I am.
